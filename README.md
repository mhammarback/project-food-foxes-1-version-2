# Build a Food Review website ðŸŒ®ðŸ¥‘

This project was made during the Technigo Bootcamp. 
We where a group of three and the majority of time this site was 
developed using mob programming. 

We practiced Javascript but also investigated Github even more. 
We all created a seperate branch and in the end we did a Merge.

Our page is built based on a random combination of cuisine, city, and design provided by the Technigo team on site. All data is fetched from the [Zomato API.](https://developers.zomato.com/)  

## Our team's combination: Seafood restaurants in Atlanta, GA

Our team has been tasked with using the Zomato API to list Seafood restaurants in Atlanta, GA in the style of the Wolt site:
![Wolt](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f7553b7451b913bfeb3b3d3217eb4247b8d5bc1d/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4d6c4e4a4959442e706e67)

## How to complete this task


We build the a solid foundation together using mob programing and then we split up and created seperate branches to cower more tasks in a faster pace. 

In the end result we manage to have a functional website with these features: 

* The restaurant name
* The average cost for a dinner there
* The address of the restaurant
* An image (even if the restaurant does not have one)
* Aggregate rating 
* Sort function on low/high price
* Sort function on rating 
* Responsive webpage 
* Reset button
